            <p>Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or internet. 
                The web development process includes web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.

            <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it is the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

            <h2>My Experience Creating a Webpage from Scratch</h2>

            <p>I initially thought that Web Development was going to be difficult. However, creating this blog from scratch has slightly eased my worries. At first I was overwhelmed with all the instructions laid out infront of me, it seemed like a lot at first. I decided to then take it step by step and found it was less intimidating.
                There were things that I was familiar with so I started with those. The things that were new I researched and learned new ways to complete tasks. </p>
            <p>All in all, it was a manageable task and I was able to complete it. I look forward to the rest of the course.</p>
